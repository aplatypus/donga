'**the *donga***' is Australian for out in the middle of nowhere; which is a suitable place to let my weird ideas out for play.

#  overview

##  process

I liked the outline given by Pieter Hintjens in this presentation -- I want to see how it goes  in the world of design and engineering; also I reckon the approach  resonantes with an *its-up-to-you* attitude and the '*first few*' notions I want to see survive the donga

The *trick* is to frame all commits as ... a *problem* with a *solution*.  So a commit becomes a solution response to an problem, need or issue.  Not a "want".

##  marketing myopia

**problem**:

Why?  I've cited Levitt (1960) paper enough times now that I remember the date.  My version of the whole thing is this;  people designing and specifying things endlessly make the same basic mistakes by focusing on the idea instead of the '*customer*' and *the market* (competition).

There's different ways folk act out their myopia, *imho*.  You will recognise some common software project behavious like make it clever, keep-it-simple then add extras (no longer simple), remain committed to "the plan", just making it up, build to a date/limitation; to name a few.

How do you resolve that in a software and systems context?  I suppose that's where the crazy ideas come from.  

##  responsive design

**solution** (01):

A '*responsive design*', to me, is a design that can quickly and flexibly respond to the business-needs of the moment.  This view evolved over time working with 4 or 5 softwares, middlewares and tools that could/did implement responsive solutions.  Part of the design is to be responsive to change requests, new features, allowing switching between (conflicting) options and blending of mixed options.  So the product (artefact, the software) responds at a functional level.  Not just a mixure few layout, content and resize changes -- I'd call that *responsive ux*.

**solution** (02):

Computerise.  

Software people need to let go of the 10th Century artisan approach to code.  In most software factories, people still make code the time-honoured way, by hand.  When you are not the one doing the work, things that make your architecture or structure *responsive* are less 'hard work' and more like a *why not* idea.

Bed time (to be continued ...)
